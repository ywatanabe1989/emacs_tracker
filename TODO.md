# TODO - emacs-tracker-context

## High Priority

### Dependencies & Installation
- [ ] Install MCP library (`pip install mcp`) when available
- [ ] Test full MCP server startup with dependencies
- [ ] Verify emacsclient is available on target systems

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Install pytest and run full test suite
- [ ] Add integration tests with real Emacs instances
- [ ] Test with actual emacsclient connections
- [ ] Validate MCP protocol compliance

### Documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples with actual MCP client connections
- [ ] Document privacy considerations and data handling
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add performance considerations documentation

## Medium Priority

### Data Provision Enhancements  
- [ ] Add CSV and Org format exports in `export_data`
- [ ] Implement real-time tracking with configurable intervals
- [ ] Add more granular data collection (key presses, mouse events)
- [ ] Implement data anonymization features
- [ ] Add structured data schemas for better client consumption

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
- [ ] Implement configuration file support
- [ ] Add input validation for all MCP tool parameters
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] Review and implement data sanitization
- [ ] Add configurable data retention policies
- [ ] Implement secure storage options
- [ ] Add opt-out mechanisms for sensitive data

## Low Priority

### Advanced Data Features
- [ ] Integration with external analytics tools (data export only)
- [ ] Multi-user support and data isolation
- [ ] Historical data persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Custom data collection plugins
- [ ] Structured data validation and schemas

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add development docker container
- [ ] Create development environment setup script
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Implement continuous integration pipeline

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize data storage and retrieval
- [ ] Implement data compression for large datasets
- [ ] Add caching layers for frequent queries
- [ ] Profile and optimize elisp evaluation calls

## Completed âœ…

### Project Structure

- [x] Implemented Tracker core functionality
- [x] Created EmacsClient for emacs interaction
- [x] Set up MCP server framework
- [x] Added comprehensive tool definitions

### Build & Packaging
- [x] Created setup.py for package installation
- [x] Added requirements.txt with dependencies
- [x] Implemented MANIFEST.in for distribution
- [x] Created run_tests.sh test runner
- [x] Added test infrastructure with pytest

### Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [x] Documented all MCP tools and their purposes
- [x] Added installation and usage instructions
- [x] Preserved original CLAUDE.md project instructions

### Testing
- [x] Basic package import functionality verified

## Notes

### Current Status
The project is functionally complete and ready for use once the MCP library dependency is installed. The core tracking functionality works independently and can be tested without MCP.

### Next Steps
1. Install MCP library dependency
2. Run full test suite with pytest
3. Test integration with Claude Code
4. Begin feature enhancements based on usage feedback

### Known Limitations
- Requires emacsclient to be available and configured
- MCP library dependency needs to be installed separately
- Real-time tracking not yet fully implemented
- Advanced analytics features are basic implementations
